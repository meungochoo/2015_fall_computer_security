# 2015 Fall Computer Security Projects
Project codes which made in this course.

## 1. Klee
Do symbolic execution with some codes. Because I used sample code of [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz), there aren't  my own codes.

## 2. Sandboxing
Implement sandbox with ptrace or seccomp.

## 3. TBA
I don't know yet. Only hope no another project :)
